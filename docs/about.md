> You want to make changes. How do you do that?

If you would like to make changes to this wiki, you have two options:

- If you don't have any coding backround or don't feel comforatable modifying this wiki yourself, contact me (Bryce Roethel) in Teams or send an email to br88c@badfirmware.com
- If you feel up to the task and want to modify the code yourself, fork from my code [here](https://github.com/BR88C/fairport-robotics-electronics-wiki) and make changes. This node module, docsify, operates with .md files, so make changes there. You will also most likeley have to install docsify-cli globally to test your changes. For more information, see [docsify's documentation](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart).
