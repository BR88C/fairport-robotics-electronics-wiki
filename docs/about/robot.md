# What do we do with the robot?

> Team 578 builds robots as a whole, but what does electronics do?

Electronics works on everything electrical on the robot as well as pneumatics. We wire everything to be controlled by a main "brain" called a RoboRio, which allows software to control the robot. Pneumatics are not always used every year, due to them not being needed in a mechanism or because it could cause the robot to be overweight (FIRST has a limitation that a robot cannot be over 125 pounds as of the 2020 season).
