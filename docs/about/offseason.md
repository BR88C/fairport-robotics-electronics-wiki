# What do we do in the off-season?

> There's plenty to do during build season. What do we do when it isn't build season?

In the off-season, electronics normally works on side projects that make things easier during the season or for testing purposes. Here are a couple examples of what we have made:

- PWM Box :

    A PWM Box is a small box that allows us to control motors for prototyping. We have made a couple, with older boxes using analog wiring while the newest 2018 and 2019 PWM boxes useÂ an Arduino and a SPARK motor controller.


- Battery Tester:

    This is different from a Battery Beak, which is used to find a battery's charge. Our battery tester tests the battery life of batteries, so that we can gauge how good a battery is and, when we have too many batteries, which ones to get rid of.

- Pneumatics Testing Board:

    Our pneumatics testing board is the entirety of a pneumatics system; a compressor, air tank, pressure switch, gauge, pressure regulator, and 2 solenoids. It can be controlled manually by switches or with the PCM that is attatched.
